# FriendFinder
This is an application which matches you with others people based on a short personality quiz. 

To use Friend Finder, clone this repository to your computer, then write the command "npm install" in git bash or terminal.

Once the dependancies are installed via npm, type in "node server.js" into the command line, and then open your browser and go to "http://localhost:8080" to use the page.  

Please note that the port might change from "8080", but the application should tell you in the command line which port is being used by the program.
